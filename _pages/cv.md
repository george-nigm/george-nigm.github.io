<summary>Samsung Research Russia (Jul 2021 ‚Äì Present, Moscow, Russia) <br> Machine Learning R&D Engineer / Sensor Solutions Team, Life Care Solutions lab.</summary>

+ Developed regression models for estimation BFM (Body fat mass), SMM (Skeletal muscle mass), ICW & ECW(Intracellular
Extracellular water) by a multi-frequency signal (released in Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy Watch 4)

+ Designed system of Data Quality estimation, detection erroneous measurements and classifying user usage errors basedonOutliers‚Äô
Detection algorithms. Quality metric increased by 21% compared to heuristics.

+ Developed Sweat loss estimation algorithm. Accelerometer-based Neural Network estimates running distance (MAPE=7.7%, R2=0.95and
Polynomial Kernel Ridge Regression estimates the loss in ml (RMSEBWP=0.3%, R2=0.79).
