## WORK EXPERIENCE

<details>
<summary><strong>Machine Learning Research Group</strong> (Oxford, United Kingdom)<br>Sep 2024 – Present</summary>
<ul>
<li>Research Engineer / Quantitative Finance Stream</li>
<li>Developing Machine Learning framework to analyze the Price Impact of Market Orders, Limit Orders and Cancellations. Utilizing autoregressive modeling to account for history-dependent effects, improving forecast accuracy and trade execution efficiency for small tick stocks by capturing internal order book fluctuations</li>
<li>Creating a Generative AI model for sequence prediction in NASDAQ limit order books, leveraging a deep state space model and custom tokenizer to simulate realistic order flows. Increasing mid-price return forecast accuracy and a correlation with realized returns, enhancing potential for reinforcement learning in high-frequency trading applications</li>
</ul>

<details>
<summary><strong>Samsung R&D Institute</strong> (Remote, South Korea)<br>Jul 2021 – Jun 2024</summary>
<ul>
<li>Machine Learning Engineer / Sensor Solution Team</li>
<li>Developed Sweat loss estimation algorithm. Accelerometer-based Neural Network estimates running distance (MAPE =7.7%, R2=0.95) and Polynomial Kernel Ridge Regression estimates the loss in ml (RMSEBWP=0.3%, R2=0.79)</li>
<li>Developed regression models for estimation of BFM (Body fat mass), SMM (Skeletal muscle mass), ICW & ECW (Intracellular / Extracellular water) by a multi-frequency signal (released in Samsung's Galaxy Watch 4)</li>
<li>Developed Body Temperature algorithm for a smartwatch. SVM on perfusion signals detect the presence of heat (Accuracy=0.91, F1=0.87) and Ridge Regression estimates the core temperature in ℃ (MSE=0.19, R2= 0.77) based on dynamical, thermal, environmental and anthropometric data. Best performance among competitors</li>
</ul>
