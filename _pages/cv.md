<!-- Work experience -->
======
* Samsung Research Russia (Jul 2021 – Present, Moscow, Russia)<br>
_Machine Learning R&D Engineer / Sensor Solution Team, Life Care Solutions lab_.
  * Developed regression models for estimation BFM (Body fat mass), SMM (Skeletal muscle mass), ICW & ECW(Intracellular / Extracellular water) by a multi-frequency signal (released in Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4)
  * Designed system of data quality estimation, detection erroneous measurements and classifying user usage errors based on outliers’ detection algorithms. Quality metric increased by 21% compared to heuristics.
  * Developed Sweat loss estimation algorithm. Accelerometer-based Neural Network estimates running distance (MAPE=7.7%, R2=0.95) and Polynomial Kernel Ridge Regression estimates the loss in ml (RMSEBWP=0.3%, R2=0.79).

Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Aug 2020 – Jul 2022, Moscow, Russia)<br>
Researcher / Laboratory of applied research Skoltech-Sberbank.
* Developed an active learning algorithm modified by anomaly detection for planning experiments. The number of required labeling has beenreduced by 58%, the quality of the regression model has been improved by 19%
* Researched the uncertainty scores (total, data, knowledge) using a Bayesian ensemble of decision trees, and anomaly detection methods;researched correlation dependencies of uncertainty / abnormality scores.

* Bank Orenburg (Jun 2019 – Jul 2020, Orenburg, Russia)
  * Analyst, Data Scientist / Information technology Department.
  * Forecasted the ATM daily cash demands based on Triple Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, Neural Networks, SSA
  * Developed a discrete model of optimal cash management in ATM branches using dynamic programming, which increased the profitabilitycompared to the classical model by 30%.
