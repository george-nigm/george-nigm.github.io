## Work expirience

<details>
<summary>Samsung R\&D Institute Russia (Jul 2021 – Present, Moscow, Russia) <br> Machine Learning R&D Engineer / Sensor Solutions Team, Life Care Solutions lab.</summary>
<ul>
<li> Developed regression models for estimation BFM (Body fat mass), SMM (Skeletal muscle mass), ICW & ECW(Intracellular
Extracellular water) by a multi-frequency signal (released in Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4)</li>
<li> Designed system of Data Quality estimation, detection erroneous measurements and classifying user usage errors basedonOutliers’
Detection algorithms. Quality metric increased by 21% compared to heuristics</li>
<li> Developed Sweat loss estimation algorithm. Accelerometer-based Neural Network estimates running distance (MAPE=7.7%, R2=0.95and
Polynomial Kernel Ridge Regression estimates the loss in ml (RMSEBWP=0.3%, R2=0.79).</li>
</ul>

<details>
<summary>Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Aug 2020 – Jul 2022, Moscow, Russia) <br> Researcher / Laboratory of applied research Skoltech-Sberbank.</summary>
<ul>
<li> Developed an active learning algorithm modified by anomaly detection for planning experiments. The number of required labeling has been reduced by 58%, the quality of the regression model has been improved by 19%</li>
<li> Researched the uncertainty scores (total, data, knowledge) using a Bayesian ensemble of decision trees, and anomaly detection methods; researched correlation dependencies of uncertainty/abnormality scores.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Bank Orenburg (Jun 2019 – Jul 2020, Orenburg, Russia)</summary>
<ul>
<li> Forecasted the ATM daily cash demands based on Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, Neural Networks, SSA.</li>
<li> Developed a Discrete model of optimal cash management in ATM branches on forecasted cash withdrawals using Dynamic programming,which increased the profitability compared to the classical model by 30%.</li>
</ul>
