### Samsung Research Russia (Jul 2021 – Present, Moscow, Russia) <br> Machine Learning R&D Engineer / Sensor Solutions Team, Life Care Solutions lab.
* Developed regression models for estimation BFM (Body fat mass), SMM (Skeletal muscle mass), ICW & ECW(Intracellular /Extracellular water) by a multi-frequency signal (released in Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4)
* Designed system of Data Quality estimation, detection erroneous measurements and classifying user usage errors based onOutliers’ Detection algorithms. Quality metric increased by 21% compared to heuristics.
* Developed Sweat loss estimation algorithm. Accelerometer-based Neural Network estimates running distance (MAPE=7.7%, R2=0.95)and Polynomial Kernel Ridge Regression estimates the loss in ml (RMSEBWP=0.3%, R2=0.79).

### Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Aug 2020 – Jul 2022, Moscow, Russia) <br> Researcher / Laboratory of applied research Skoltech-Sberbank.
* Developed an Active Learning algorithm modified by Anomaly Detection for planning experiments. The number of required labelinghas beenreduced by 58%, the quality of the regression model has been improved by 19%.
* Researched the Uncertainty Quantification (total, data, knowledge scores) using a Bayesian ensemble of decision trees, andanomaly detection methods; researched correlation dependencies of Uncertainty / Abnormality scores.

### Bank Orenburg (Jun 2019 – Jul 2020, Orenburg, Russia) <br> Analyst, Data Scientist / Information technology Department.
* Forecasted the ATM daily cash demands based on Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, Neural Networks, SSA.
* Developed a Discrete model of optimal cash management in ATM branches on forecasted cash withdrawals using Dynamic programming,which increased the profitability compared to the classical model by 30%.
